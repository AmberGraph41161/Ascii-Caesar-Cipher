# Ascii-Caesar-Cipher

2nd Project AFter the whole "Custom Shutdown Dialogue" stuff I did.

This is a "encoder" and "decoder" that "encrypts" documents by shifting all of the ascii values within the document by a specified ammount.
I think I said this in my last project, but I'll say it again, I am no professional at coding, and this was a project just for the fun of it.
Any constructive criticism or feedback would be awesome! I am trying to get better at coding through making these "small" little projects.
