# Ascii-Caesar-Cipher

2nd Project AFter the whole "Custom Shutdown Dialogue" stuff I did.

This is a "encoder" and "decoder" that "encrypts" documents by shifting all of the ascii values within the document by a specified ammount.
I think I said this in my last project, but I'll say it again, I am no professional at coding, and this was a project just for the fun of it.
Any constructive criticism or feedback would be awesome! I am trying to get better at coding through making these "small" little projects.


If you are compiling this on your own pc, make sure that the executable is in the same location as the "resources" folder, becuase the code doesn't or shouldn't work without the "resources" folder in the same location/path as where it's at.
